- Inital Commit
Uploaded initial prototype project with bare minimum of functionality. Site is capable of fetching data from OpenWeatherMap API.
https://openweathermap.org/api

Project was made with CreateReactApp

- Consept for the project.
The projects main goal is for me to learn new technologies and to intersect with my own interests.

Front
The site is supposed to be anime themed interactive weathersite. Where the major feature is that when user searches for city the character changes according to weather in that city. For example if in Oulu it is cold and snowing the character is shown in winter clothes with winter background.

Backend
For learning purposes site should have working backend wich stores and fetches data from database. For now I've leaning towards NodeJS for the backend. And for database I haven't decided techonology yet.

- Todo
Working backend for the site and somekind of barebones protype of the front.
